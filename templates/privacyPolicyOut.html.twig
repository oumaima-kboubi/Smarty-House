                                be used

                                access to Membership benefits. We may also use this information to later contact you for
                                a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional information

                                companies e.g., vendors that process credit card orders (when buying new smart devices
                                or maintaining existing smart devices) , and
                                other companies who provide us marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data,
                                assist us with customer service, etc. Except as provided in this

                            <h4>IP Addresses:</h4>
                            <p>An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
                                are surfing the Internet. Web servers (computers that "serve up" web pages)
                                automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When visitors request pages from
                                our Websites, our servers typically log their IP addresses. We collect IP addresses for
                                purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate information to
                                others, and to track the use of our Website. IP addresses are considered non-personal
                                information and may also be shared as provided above. We reserve the right to use IP
                                addresses and any personally identifiable information to identify a visitor when we feel
                                it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Website rules or to: (a) fulfill a
                                government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal process; (c)
                                protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Website, or other users; or (d) in
                                an emergency to protect the health and safety of our Website's users or the general
                                public.</p>

                                "Cookies" are small text files from a website that are stored on your hard drive. These
                                text files make using our Website more convenient by, among other things, saving your
                                passwords and preferences for you. Cookies themselves do not typically contain any
                                personally identifiable information. We may analyze the information derived from these
                                cookies and match this information with data provided by you or another party.

                                If you are concerned about the storage and use of cookies, you may be able to direct
                                your internet browser to notify you and seek approval whenever a cookie is being sent to
                                your hard drive. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive through your

                                will not function properly or be available to you if you refuse to accept a cookie or
                                choose to disable the acceptance of cookies.

                            <p>If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personally
                                identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your

                                that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, social security
                                numbers, or bank account information, to us by email. However, aside from our reply to
                                such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you request a
                                particular service or sign up for a feature that involves email communications, we are
                                sending you information about our other services, or you consented to
                                being contacted by email for a particular purpose. In certain instances, we may provide
                                you with the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications from us;

                                required to do so by law, with respect to copyright or other intellectual property
                                infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is necessary to: (a) fulfill a
